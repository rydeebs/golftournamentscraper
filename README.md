# Golf Tournament Scraper - Deployment Guide

## Deployment Instructions

We're encountering persistent issues with package dependencies in the full application. This guide provides a step-by-step approach to get a working deployment.

### Step 1: Start with the Bare Minimum

1. Use only these two files:
   - `app.py` - A minimal Streamlit application
   - `requirements.txt` - Contains only `streamlit`

2. Push these changes to your repository.

3. This should deploy successfully since it has minimal dependencies.

### Step 2: Once Deployed, Gradually Add Functionality

After confirming the minimal app works:

1. Add the `requests` library to requirements.txt:
   ```
   streamlit
   requests
   ```

2. Add basic URL fetching to app.py.

3. Push these changes and verify they work.

4. Add the `beautifulsoup4` library to requirements.txt:
   ```
   streamlit
   requests
   beautifulsoup4
   ```

5. Add basic HTML parsing to app.py.

6. Continue this gradual approach until you have a fully working application.

### Troubleshooting Tips

If you encounter errors:

1. **Check Logs**: Look for specific error messages about which packages are failing.

2. **Version Pinning**: Try specifying older versions of packages:
   ```
   streamlit==1.22.0
   requests==2.28.0
   beautifulsoup4==4.11.0
   ```

3. **Environmental Variables**: Some hosting platforms allow you to set environment variables to control the build process:
   ```
   STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT=8501
   ```

4. **Reduce Requirements**: If adding a specific package causes errors, look for alternatives or simplify your approach.

### Key Insights from Previous Errors

The main issue appears to be with packages that require compilation, especially:

- **Pillow**: A dependency of Streamlit that requires zlib development libraries
- **pandas**: Requires numpy and other compiled dependencies

By using this incremental approach, we can identify exactly which package is causing problems and find appropriate workarounds.

## Next Steps

Once you have a working deployment with the basic functionality, you can explore these options:

1. Look for pre-built wheels of problematic packages
2. Use CDN-hosted libraries for data visualization instead of Python libraries
3. Consider using a different hosting platform with better support for compiled dependencies

Good luck with your deployment!
